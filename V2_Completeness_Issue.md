Potential Issues & Suggestions:
* Placeholders & Omissions: Some methods are incomplete or have placeholder comments (e.g., forward passes, some print/reporting logic, and online learning triggers).
* Error Handling: The code assumes data and directories exist; more robust error handling for missing files or malformed data would help.
* Resource Usage: The default settings (large batch size, long sequences, many epochs) may require significant GPU resources.
* Testing: The test and validation logic is present, but actual test data and some evaluation logic are placeholders.
* Documentation: While docstrings are present, more inline comments would help for complex logic, especially in the model and evaluation sections.
